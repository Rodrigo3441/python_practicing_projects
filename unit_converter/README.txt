Unit converter

A unit converter for:
Fahrenheit <-> Celsius
Kilometeres <-> Miles
Kg <-> Pounds

I tried to use only one function for doing the calculus, the program filters what calculus will be made by the user entry

If the user enters {CF} (celsius to fahrenheit) the function will work for this case.

It uses:
flexible interface: only one functions, two operations.
Modules: for every unit implemented, it will be in a independent module, to make it reusable

Updates history:
January 29th 2026:
I implemented and completed the Fahrenheit <-> Celsius conversor
the next unit will be Kilometers <-> Miles
