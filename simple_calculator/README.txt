A simple calculator
I made a calculator where i could only use one function for doing the calculus 

The program will:

1- Ask for the operation the user want to do
2- Ask for the two operation numbers
3- return the result

I used:
In operator: for checking if the operator the user entered were allowed (+,-,/,*)
try...except: for validating invalid inputs

os library: for improving the CLI, using functions like pause (pausing the console) and cls (cleaning the screem)

save_in_history: my own module for saving the calc history in csv files (one file for every operation)
