Number Guessing Game

A small game I made for improving my logical skills.
This game will:
Ask the user for a number interval;
Generate a random number in this interval;
And the user must guess the random number until get it correct

During the guessing, the game will say 'to high' or 'to low' for the number the user enters
when the user find the number, the game show how many attempts were needed
